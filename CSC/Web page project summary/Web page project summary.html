<h1>
    How to create a more sophisticated AI that more accurately replicates human behaviour.
</h1>

<p>
    From January 2020 onwards, I set out on creating an abstract card game model and an AI that can play any game made using that model. To do this, I have first ventured into the abstract card game aspect of this task. I began making it in Python but I later decided that it was better if I jumped over to Java instead. I was more comfortable coding in OOP in Java and I could later use Java to create an android app implementation of this task. After completing all the base classes in Java, I again jumped to a different language. This time it was C#. I decided that C# was a better option than Java as it can utilise the Unity engine as well as the .NET libraries. This is much more flexible than sticking to just android app development. It also allows whatever I produce to be more valuable in the long term as there are multiple different ways to implement my single C# script.
</p>

<p>
    As I have created an abstract card game, the next logical step beyond this would be to create games on top of this. I have created Uno with this model, but I could do much more. A larger objective, for myself, would be to have a procedurally generated card game maker. Where I could just let my script created randomised rules and see what works. My AI would need to work with it all. My goal is to have my AI play these games and see which ones provide a suitable level of difficulty. If the AI wins too much or loses too much, then it isn’t as valuable as a game that is somewhere in the middle. A fair and challenging experience is generally an enjoyable one.
</p>

<p>
    I looked at existing examples online, but I haven’t really seen any that achieve this goal. I did, however, find some projects that had pieces of what I was trying to achieve. These pieces helped me see how they could be used together to form a valuable project.

        This is a reddit thread about creating abstract strategy board games. When initially tackling the issue of creating an abstract, parameterizable card game, I first needed to understand how to think about it correctly. Comments on this thread helped me think about games more computationally. Instead of thinking about what the rules of a game are, they suggested thinking about the fundamental building blocks of what a game is. As explained near the beginning of my how-to guide, card games are essentially a series of transactions between lists of cards until a condition is met.

        This is a University study on using Monte Carlo tree search algorithms to play poker squares. This gave me some insight into how to layout a formal document with technical information and statistics throughout. I will use this in my how-to upon completion. This project is similar to my own, but it doesn’t have the same goal. They are studying the performance of multiple different machine learning algorithms, but I am looking to create only one. This project is the most similar to my own that I have found. This has led me to conclude that what I am trying to achieve has great value and would be of use to others who are also looking into creating their own turn-based game.

<p>
    I would like to see others pick up my code and be able to develop their own game, using my class structures, and have my AI be able to play it and determine if their game is appropriately difficult. They can use the AI as a test for gauging difficult levels for the game and/or to play against inside the game itself. If I can do this, then someone else will have a greater opportunity to push it even further and maybe achieve my end goal of a procedurally generated game maker.
